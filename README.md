# Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**The aim of this project** is to perform a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to uncover insights about the passengers and factors affecting their survival.

## Objectives

- **Data Loading and Inspection:**  
  - Load the dataset.
  - Examine its structure, including the number of rows, columns, and basic information about the data.

- **Data Analysis:**  
  - Explore various aspects of the data, such as unique values in key columns like gender.
  - Perform a descriptive analysis to understand the distribution of data.

- **Survival Rate Analysis:**  
  - Focus on understanding the survival rate of passengers based on different features such as gender, class, and age group.

- **Data Visualization:**  
  - Create various visualizations, including boxplots, countplots, and more, to visually represent the trends and patterns in the dataset.

- **Conclusion:**  
  - Summarize the findings and insights drawn from the analysis.
  - Provide recommendations that can be used to inform further studies or model building.

## Key Features

- **Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn:**  
  Utilized these libraries to efficiently handle data and create insightful visualizations.

- **In-Depth Analysis:**  
  Conducted detailed analysis on different variables, focusing on survival trends across various passenger demographics.

- **Comprehensive Visualizations:**  
  Included visual tools like boxplots and countplots to provide a clear understanding of the data.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine.
2. **Ensure that you have the required Python libraries installed** (`pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`).
